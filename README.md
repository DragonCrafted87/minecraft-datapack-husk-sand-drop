# minecraft-datapack-husk-sand-drop

Like it says on the tin Husks drop sand use with the carpet mod and
turn on husks spawn in desert temples

If using with another pack that modifies the husk loot table you will
need to manually merge the loot tables and make sure there is only 1
override as we do not yet have a way to just append to the table
